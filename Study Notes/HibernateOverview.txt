Hibernate Overview

What is Hibernate?
	Hibernate ORM is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language
		ORM in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages
		Incompatible Type Example
		Object in Java
		Object stored in Database
		
		Bigger Picture
		Java Object interact thru Hibernate to Database
		
		Benefits
			1. Hibernate is database independent
			2. Handles low level SQL for you
			3. Minimizes JDBC related code in your App.
			
		Example ORM in Action
			
		Session Factory
			-Session Factory creates session objects
			-SessionFactory is heavyweight object so usually it is created during application start up and used later
		
		Session	
			-A session is used to get a physical connection with a database.
			-The session object is lightweight and short lived object
			-Not thread safe
