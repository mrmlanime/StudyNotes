Hi Sir Kirby,
 
What did you accomplish since last meeting? 

Partially covered Spring boot microservices development. Reviewed with my past projects and how to migrate it to Spring or MVC Maven project. 

What did you accomplish today? 

Reviewed o Spring boot microservices and RESTful API development. Reviewed again with front-end libraries and started to explore Angular JS framework. Starting to review JUnit testing and Spring project management scenarios. 

What is impeding you from working most effectively? 

1. Travel Issue: Need to prepare my travel going to Cebu as preparation for family relocation to Cebu. 
2. Internet Issue: Instability of internet connection recently. Possible solution: Use at least 2 ISP, (Globe and Smart) in case one of the ISPs has connection issues.

Regards,

Mark
